- Also I'm exploring the use of [Obsidian](https://obsidia.md), a note taking app that is highly customizable and that has a thriving community of open source pluging creators to share markdown notes using this repository. You can find this notes in the notes folder. The starting page is [Welcome.md](notes/Welcome.md).
