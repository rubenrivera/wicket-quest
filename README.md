## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
   - Google Workspace for personal, team, small organizations use.
   - Google Apps Script and Google Editors (Docs, Forms, Sheets, Slides).
   - Personal Developement Plans on using Computers (including mobile devices, programming, etc.).

## Now
Now I'm exploring:
- Using this âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ GitHub's repository. It's special because GitHub shows README.md, this file, on my GiHub profile.
- Using [Obsidian](https://obsidia.md), a note taking app that is highly customizable and that has a thriving community of open source pluging creators to share markdown notes using this repository. You can find this notes in the notes folder. The starting page is [Welcome.md](notes/Welcome.md).
- [Userscript](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Userscript)s. Userscripts are not new for me, but I haven't use them too much. Recently I revisted this topic looking for an effective way to export Stack Overflow posts to an Obsidian vault. You can find this script on the [userscripts](userscripts) folder, or following this link: [exportToObsidian.user.js](userscripts/exportToObsidian.user.js).
