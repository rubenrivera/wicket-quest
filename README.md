## Now
Now I'm exploring:
- Using this âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ GitHub's repository. It's special because GitHub shows README.md, this file, on my GitHub profile.
- Sponsorship platforms (GitHub, Buy me a coffee, ...).
- Using [Obsidian](https://obsidia.md), a note taking app that is highly customizable and that has a thriving community of open source pluging creators to share markdown notes using this repository. You can find this notes in the notes folder. The starting page is [Welcome.md](notes/Welcome.md).
- [Userscript](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Userscript)s. They are not new for me, but I haven't use them too much. Recently I revisted this topic looking for an effective way to export Stack Overflow posts to an Obsidian vault. You can find the resulting script on the [userscripts](userscripts) folder, or following this link: [exportToObsidian.user.js](userscripts/exportToObsidian.user.js).
